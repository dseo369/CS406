<h1><b>Action RPG Project</b></h1>

My project will be an Action Role Play Game (ARPG), where the player will control a character who will have an inventory system, be able to wield a weapon or tool, save their progress, improve individual stats (such as strength, speed, etc), and earn Experience Points (EXP) and money to level up and buy items. This is a very basic layout of the game’s mechanics, and may be a bit ambitious for the scope of the project considering time constraints, but these are the features that the project will be working towards as a final product.

There is also no executable for the game at this point, so running this will require installation of Unreal Engine 5.3.2 and running it within the editor.
